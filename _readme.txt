The metadata categories I selected were selected to prioritize the diplomatic and cultural significance of the treaty document while addressing the practical challenges of digitizing historical materials. Instead of focusing solely on the technical aspects, I wanted to include and account for speaker representation through fields like "colonial_officials" and "indigenous_nations_mentioned," since it is a document that records a formal negotiation between sovereign nations. I included "page_type" and "content_description" to handle the friction of digitizing and capturing not just what page number appears but also what type of content each image has and how it functions within the broader treaty structure. I also added fields like "text_legibility" and "notable_physical_features" to document what was lost or gained in the digitization process, while the "historical_significance_notes" column has space for contextual analysis.
