The President representing to the Board the Necessity of dispatching the
Indians of the Six Nations, who being very numerous remain here at a great
Charges, proposed that the Consideration of the Value of the Present to be
given them, should be now proceeded upon, and accordingly the Board not
being, upon the same, and considering that their many Years there has not
been so great an Appearance here of Chiefs of these Nations as at this
time, and that they must be returned very full; and of different sorts as at the
Article of the Treaty with them in 1732; and of Opinion, that proper
Goods for them to the Value of about Two hundred Pounds, should be pro-
vided and given to them; and that to Conrad Wyser, the Interpreter, who is
extremely useful on all such Occasions, and on the present one has been
very serviceable, there be given Twenty Pounds.

At a Council held at Philadelphia, October 12, 1736.

PRESENT,
The Honourable JAMES LOGAN, Esq; President.

Samuel Preston,         Samuel Hasell,
Clement Plumsted,       Thomas Griffitts,   { Esqrs.

The President informed the Board, that agreeable to the Minute of the
4th, Care had been taken to provide Goods for the Indians: But next
Day, after Council, conferring with Conrad Wyser, the Interpreter, he had
advised that the Delivery of the Present should be delayed till the Indians
had finished with the provincial, with whom they were then treating
about the Purchase of Lands ; that nothing should be said of the Pres-
ent : the Indians had likewise been told of the Proprietary having signed
the Purchase for the Indianâ€™s Lands lying between the Kittatinny Hills
and Kekachtanin Hills, and the treaty is now mentioned to conclude, and a
Quantity of the Goods already got together, to be ready to be shown on the
Submission ; that nothing be forgot ; but the Business of the Board have
choice of their Choice for the large Belt of Wampum, which they are
ready to deliver, and the Present be given in Council. It is considering
the Value of the Present for this Government, to be great a Present as
necessary under the Circumstances; but that it may very well not exceed
what was given at the last Treaty. It is Ordered, that it be given a Present
between Sixty and Seventy Pounds.

The President likewise acquainting the Board, that the Indians, at a
Meeting with the Proprietor and him, had taken Notice that Conrad Wyser,
and Shekallamy, were by the Treaty of 1732, appointed as fit and proper
Persons to go between the Six Nations and this Government, and to be
employed in all Transactions with one another, whose Bodies the Indians
said were to be equally divided between them and us, we to have one half,
and they the other; that they had found Conrad faithful and honest,
that he is a true good Man, and had spoke their Words, and our Words,
and not his own; and the Indians having presented him with a dress Skin
to make him Shoes, and two Deer Skins, to keep him warm, they said,
as they had thus taken Care of our Friend, they must recommend theirs
(Shekallamy) to our Notice; and the Board judging it necessary that a parti-
