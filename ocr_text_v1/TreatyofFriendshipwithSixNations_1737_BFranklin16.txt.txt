"it, would hand it out by stealth in small Quantities, but the Indians when
"they take it, drink it off by great Quantities; so that no Method we
"can find will prevent the Indians having it, till they are so wise as to
"refrain it of themselves; and, Why are they not so wise? they shew very
"good strong Sense in other things, and why cannot they act like us?
"All of us here, and all of any of Credit in the Place, can every Day
"have as much Rum of their own to drink as they please, and yet scarce
"one of us will take a Dram, at least not one Man will on any Ac-
"count be drunk, no not if he were hired to it with great Sums of

"And now to bind and confirm all these our Words, we have provided
"for you the following Goods, which will be delivered to you to morrow
"at the President's Lodgings, to wit.

One Hundred Pounds of Powder,
One Hundred & Fifty Pounds of Lead,
Twelve Stroud Matchcoats,
Twelve Kettles,
Twelve Blankets,
Twelve Duffels,

        Twenty five Hatchets,
        One Hundred Knives,
        Thirty one Yards and 1/2 of half thick,
        Two Hundred Flints,
        One dozen Looking-Glasses,
        Three dozen Scissars.

With some Tobacco, Pipes, Rum, and Sugar.


The Council rising, and the President with the Proprietor staying, the In-
dians entered into further Discourse, and said, They had received a Message
with some Wampum from the Governor of Maryland, informing them, he had

not be wronged of their Lands, that he had understood this Government had
wronged them, and if they would send some of their People to him, to whomso-
ever they should be wronged, he would write to the great King, who would give
such Orders as that they should have Justice done them. Being asked how this was
perceived at the Masse, they said, The Message brought to them was there known only to them, they had the Wampum and would have it in 1744, and they carefully pre-
served it, and would write to the Governors of Maryland and Virginia, that they would
Satisfy them for the Lands belonging to them (the Indians) which the People of
those Governments were possessed of that had never been purchased of them, and
that if the Lands on Sasquehannah and Chanawaons were theirs, and they were not
dissatisfied to let go then, but if not, they would assist as for the Lands they now re-

the Southward for those Lands.

They were told, That on their receiving the Present to morrow, they
should be answered on these Heads; and after being entertained by the Pro-
prietor, they withdrew.
