great Trouble to us to fee any of them taken with that Distemper, after they had
travelled fo far to visit us; for we are very defirous they should all return safe, and
as healthy as they came to us: That it is proper they should give their Answer at
Philadelphia, 7a the fame publick Manner we had laf treated with thems; but it
is adviseable they should spend no more of their time in the Town, than will be ab-
solutely necessary, for many Inconveniences may attend it.

They appeared concerned at this, thanked us, and said they would go to-
gether by themlelves to advise on it.

September 29.

The Gentlemen of the Council having gone home last night to Philadel-
phia, and only the Proprietor staying, Mr Preston with some others came a-
gain to day; and the Indian Chiefs after they had consulted this Morning a-
mongst themfelves, meeting the Proprietor, &c. in Council, said,

That they were much obliged to us for the Care we took of them; we shewed by
it our true Friendship for them. That as they are now with us, they put them-
selves wholly under our Direction, and tho’ Philadelphia is the Place where their
Fire is kept for them, yet 1t may upon Occasion be brought out hither; and they
are free either to proceed to Philadelphia to treat at the Fire there, or to stay
here, as we shall think fit to order it.

They were told, As the last Treaty with them was held in Publick at Phila-
delphia, it would be necessary they should there give their Answer ; That we were
not wholly again their going to Town, but thought ourselves obliged to acquaint
them with the Danger; yet that this 1s not at present so great that it should
wholly prevent their going. The Distemper is as yet but young and just begun in
the Place ; that it is only in the Heart or near the Middle of the Town; that they
will be accommodated at the Edge or Out-Skirts of the Town, where if they take
Care, they may for a few Days be in but very little or no Danger.

    They then resolved to let out for Philadelphia the next Day; and accord-
ingly having been entertained at Stenton three Nights, they went to Town
on the last of September ; and having rested the first of October, on the fecond
Day they met as follows.

At a Council held in the Great Mecting-Houfé at Philadelphia,
the 2d Day of October 1736.
