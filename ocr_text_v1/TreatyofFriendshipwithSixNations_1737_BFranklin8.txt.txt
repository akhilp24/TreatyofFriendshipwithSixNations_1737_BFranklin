By the Interpreter’s Advice, they were first spoke to in their own Way, with three small Strings of Wampum in Hand, one of which was delivered on each of the following Articles:

Our Friends and Brethren,

I. You are come a great way, and have doubtless suffered many Hardships in so long a Journey; we therefore, and wish you Brethren and true Friends, who have long been in Friendship and Alliance with your Nations; you must therefore put a-
way all Grief and Uneasiness, and bright your Eyes, that we may see and be chearful wiht each other.

II. We desire that as we are now met as Brethren and Friends, you will open
