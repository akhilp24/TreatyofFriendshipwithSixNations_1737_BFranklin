BRETHREN,

BRETHREN,

"ONE of the chief Articles of our late Treaty together, was the
"brightning of the Chain of Friendship between us, and the preferving
"it free from all Rust and Spots; and that this Chain was not only be-
"tween this Government and us, but between all the Englifh Govern-
"ments and all the Indians. We now affure you our Brethren, that it is
"our earnest Desire this Chain should continue, and be strengthned be-
"tween all the English and all our Nations, and likewise the Delawares,
"Canays, and the Indians living on Sasquehannah, and all the other Indi-
"ans who now are in League and Friendship with the Six Nations; in Be-
"half of all whom, and as a lasting Confirmation of this great Article, to
"endure until this Earth passeth away and is no more seen, we now de-
"liver you this Beaver Coat.

Here he laid down a large Beaver Coat.

The Proprietor gave them Thanks in Behalf of this Government for what they
    had spoke touching these three important Articles of the Fire, Road
    and Chain of Friendship, and told them their Discourse thereon was very
    satisfactory. 

    The Speaker proceeded and said; 

BRETHREN,

" TO conclude all that we have now said, it is our Desire that we and
" you should be as of one Heart, one Mind, and one Body, thus be-
" coming one People, entertaining a mutual Love and Regard for each
" other, to be preserved firm and entire, not only between you and us,
" but between your Children, and our Children, to all succeeding Ge-
" nerations. 

" We who are now here, are old Men, who have the Direction of Affairs
" in our own Nations; and as we are old, it may be thought that the Me-
" mory of these things may be lost with us, who have not, like you, the
" Art of preserving it by committing all Transactions to Writing: We ne-
" vertheless have Methods of transmitting from Father to Son, an Ac-
" count of all these Things, whereby you will find the Remembrance of
" them is faithfully preserved, and our succeeding Generations are made
" acquainted with what has passed, that it may not be forgot as long as
" the Earth remains. 


They were told, That it was very agreeable to us to know that they took such
effectual Care in this Point.

Then proceeding he said;

BRETHREN,

"WE desire that this brightning of the Chain, and establishing a strong
"and firm League of Friendship, may be understood by you, as we
"understand it to be, not only between the Chiefs of our Nations, and the
"Chiefs or Principal Men of this Government, but likewise between all
"our People, and all your People, and between you and all our Warriors
"who go abroad and sometimes pass near this Government, to all of whom
"we have given the strictest Charge to behave themselves agreeable to the

"Friendship
