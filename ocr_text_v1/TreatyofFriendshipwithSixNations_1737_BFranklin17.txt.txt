    That they were now to speak to the Proprietor and our People for the last
time this Visit; that he had spoke to them last night, and recapitulated the Heads
of all that had been agreed between them and us, as the Fire, the Path, the
Chain, that we were now become one People; and to every other Article that had
been mentioned between us: This they will remember on their Parts through
all Generations, and they desire that we may remember the same as long as the
Earth endures.

    That having now brightened the Chain, and confirmed all the Articles necessary
for establishing perfect Friendship between them and us, and being thus become
one People, they must desire that we would be more reasonable in the Sale of our
Goods to them, as they could buy them much cheaper several times from the city of
New-York; that the Powder and the Traders of New-York, is generally
found to be much better (black Bass), so that the Bullet falls often short of the Mark
thro' the Badness of the Powder; that if we would sell cheap, we might thereby
draw all their Trade to this Province, far beyond that of any others, which would
be to our Advantage.

    And hereupon he laid down a Bundle of Skins, and said,

    That amongst them there is never any Victuals sold, the Indians give to each o-
ther freely what they can spare; but if they come amongst our People, they can have
none without paying; they admire we should take Money on this Score.

    That having now finished, and preparing to return home, as several of them
are old Men, they request that we would help them on their Journey, by affording
them Horses and good Carriages to take their Goods; that if we had not Horses
and Carriages, they desire we would spare them some for their Use, who are our
Brethren.

And hereupon he laid down two Bundles of Skins;

Then proceeding, he said,

    That they must desire us to write to the Governors of Virginia and Maryland,
who are possessed of their Lands, without ever considering the Indians for them,
and he hoped that we would take the Answers of those Governors, which next
Spring some of their Nations will come to receive at the Fire kept for them in this
Place; that they intended only to go to the great King on the other Side of the Wa-
ter, and let him know what they expect on this Head from his People.

    That if Civility at Conestogoe, should attempt to make a Sale of any Lands
from us or any of our Neighbours, they must let us know, that he has no Power to
do so; and if he does any thing of the kind, they the Indians will utterly disown him.

    That last night we told them the Woods were very dark, and that it was impos-
sible to prevent Rum being carried to Allegheny; that if that be the Case it be had
had better hinder any Persons from going thither at all, and confine our Traders at
the River Salquehannah and its Branches; for as several Indian Warriours pass
by Allegheny, where so much Rum is constantly to be had, they cannot but be ve-
ry apprehensive that some Mischief may happen; this Consideration often troubles
them.

In Answer to all which, the Indians were thus told by the Interpreter.
"THAT as to all that had passed relating to the Chain, Road and Fire,
"we have now firmly and fully established and confirmed all these 
Articles,
