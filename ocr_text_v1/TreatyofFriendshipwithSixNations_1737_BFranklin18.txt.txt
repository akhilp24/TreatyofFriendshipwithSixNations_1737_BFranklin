"Articles, to be kept in perpetual Remembrance by them and us, and by our Children and their Children to all Generations.

"That as to the Dearnefs of Goods carried amongst them, the Government here has no Concern in the Trade, it is entirely "carried on by private People; those that go amongst the Indians purchase the Goods they carry with them at the Rate, and "we are not at that considering the Length of Way they carry them, we find to do cheap, that the Traders can be but small "Gainers; but the Prices of Goods are not under any Regulation, they get for them what they can.

"That all the white People, tho' they live together as Brethren, have each nevertheless distinct Properties and Interests, "and none of us can demand from another Victuals or any thing of the Kind without Payment. One Man raises Corn and sells "it, another raises Horses and he sells them, and thus every Man lives by his own Labour and Industry, and no one has a "Right to take away from another what he thus earns for himself and all Victuals cost Money.

"That proper Care will be taken, as has formerly been done, to supply them with Horses and Carriages to make their Journey "home as easy as possible.

"That we would be glad to do them any Service with the Neighbouring Governments, but we do not clearly understand this "Matter: As to what is wrote to the Governor of Maryland, we do not believe there is any Truth in that Report; we have "indeed heard of a Letter sent up amongst them from the Governor of Maryland, if he means any thing, it is only that in "Case King George had not himself laid down Orders to that Government to enquire into the Matter. As to the Claim they "speak of, he mentions nothing further in that Matter, but it is their own Request to the People of the Lands at that "River, which is the Province of Maryland, and could not be disputed; but as the Business is not ours, we promise to "deliver their Memorial before such Governors as will be ready on this Head.

"As to the Complaint of our Traders from going into thither, they may be still positive that we, though recall scarce the "most proper Measures in our Power to hinder People from carrying Rum into Guains, and the neighbouring Indians will give "strict Charge to the Warriours to be cautious and prudent, that all Kind of Mischief may be prevented.

"The Indians appearing satisfied with what had been spoke to them, said they had nothing further to offer. The Present was 
"then delivered to them, which they received with great Thankfulness, those of each Nation alternately by themselves, and "then all of them together, joining in their usual solemn Sound, when they express their Satisfaction. Having afterwards "drank a friendly Glass, and taking Leave of the Proprietor, President and Council, they departed; and thus the Treaty ended.
