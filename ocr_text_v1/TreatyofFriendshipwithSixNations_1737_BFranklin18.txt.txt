“ That as to the Descare of Goods carried among tt cheat the Govern

ment here has no Concern in the Trade, it is. entirely carried on by pri-
vate People; thofe that go amongft the Indians purchafe the Goods es

carry with them at the eafieft Rate, and we are told, that confidering the _

Length of Way they carry them, they are fold fo cheap, that thefe Tra-
ders can be but {mall Gainers ; bat the Prices of Goods are not under any
Regulation, they get for them what they can. |

‘© That all the white People, tho’ they live together as Brethren, haye

each neverthelefs diftinct Properties and Interefts, and none of us can
demand from another Victuals or any thing of the Kind without Pay-

ment. One Man raifes Corn and fells it, another raifes Horfes and he

fells them, and thus every Man lives by his own Labour and Induftry,

and no one has a Right to take away from another what he thus: earns
for himfelf; and all Vidtuals coft Money.

“¢ ‘That proper Care will be taken, as has formerly been done, to fupply
them with Horfes and Carriages to make their Journey home as ealy as
poffible. ) "

“ That we would be glad to do them any § Service eae the Memes

ing Governments, but we do not clearly underftand this Matter: As to

what is faid ofa Letter from the King of England, we do not believe there

is any Truth in that Report; we have indeed heard of a Letter. fent up
to Safquehannah from the Governor of Maryland ; if he mentions any thing
in it of Orders from the King of England, they fhould fend fome Perfons
to that Government to enquire into the Matter. As to the Claim they
make on the Lands of Maryland and Virginia, we know not how this is

fupported; the Lands on Sa/quebaunah, we believe, belong to the Six
Nations, by the Conqueft of the Indians of that River ; Due how: their Pre-_

tentions are made’ good to the Lands to the Southward, we know not ;
and we ought to PS better informed before we can write of this Head. .

ch That we cannot prevent our Traders from going where ‘they may beft
difpofe of their Goods ; we fhall take the moft proper Meafures in our
Power to hinder their carrying Rum in fuch Quantities, and we hope the

Indians will give ftrictt Charge to the Warriours to. be cautious and
prudent, that all Kind of Mifchief may be pbechag

The Indians appearing fatisfied with what had been fpoke to them, faid
it they had nothing further to offer. The Prefent was then delivered to them,
Heo which they received with great Thankfulnefs, thofe of each Nation alter- —
| nately by lex aloes and then all of them together, joining in their ufual

folemn Sound, when they exprefs their. Satisfaction. Having afterwards
Ni drank a friendly Glafs, and taking Leave of the Proprictor, Prefident and
Wak Counc.) ae departed; and thus nl ‘Treaty ended.
