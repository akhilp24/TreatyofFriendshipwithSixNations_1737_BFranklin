“ At the lat! Treaty you advifed us to ftrengthen ourfelves by entring
into firm Leagues of Friendfhip and Alliance with feveral other Nations
of Indians around us; this Advice was truly good, and we thank our
Brethren for it’; we have accordingly treated with thefe Six following
Nations, #0 wit, the Onichkaryagoes, Siffaghees, Tioumitibagas, Attawantenis,
Twechtwefe, and Oachtamughs, and have engaged them {o heartily in our
Intereft, that they acknowledge us for their Elder Brethren, and have.
promifed to join with us as one People, and to a&t altogether in Concert
with us. .

“ You likewife then advifed us to call home all thofe of our Nations
who are at Canada, or live amongft the French, left if any Occafion of
Difference fhould arife, they might then be prevented from returning.
We efteem this likewife as found good Advice, and we thank our
Brethren for it ; the French were formerly our cruel Enemies, and we are
taking fuch Meafures-as we hope will be effe@ual to bring back our
People, if any new Ereach fhould happen. | |

prefent but very ill provided and poor, and have only a very {mall
Quantity of Skins, which neverthelefs we hope our Brethren‘ will accept.

Here he laid down two fmall Bundles of Skins.
“We have now nothing more to fay in Publick ; but having other

Matters to treat on with the Proprietor, we will enter upon them: at
another time... | | |

delivered their Anfwer, fo now the Council would meet and confider together of
all that had paffed at prefent. | inns

Which being intetpreted to them, they expreffed their Satisfa@tion by a |

Sound peculiar to them, in which they all joined, and then withdtew.
