""Friendship which is established between you and us, that so we all may
"continue to be one People for ever.

""At the last Treaty you advised us to strengthen ourselves by entring
"into firm Leagues of Friendship and Alliance with several other Nations
"of Indians around us; this Advice was truly good, and we thank our
"Brethren for it: we have accordingly treated with these Six following
"Nations, viz the Onachkaryagoes, Sissisoghees, Tionontitakagas, Atawantanes,
"Twichtwees, and Oouttanunghs, and have engaged them so heartily in our
"Interest, that they acknowledge us for their Elder Brethren, and have
"promised to join with us as one People, and to act altogether in Concert
"with us.

""You likewise then advised us to call home all those of our Nations
"who are at Canada, or live amongst the French, lest if any Occasion of
"Difference should arise, they might then be prevented from returning.
"We esteem this likewise as sound good Advice, and we thank our
"Brethren for it: the French were formerly our cruel Enemies, and we
"are taking such Measures as we hope will be effectual to bring back our
"People, if any new Breach should happen.

The Speaker said:
""To confirm all that we have now said, we would be glad if we had a
"large Present of Skins to deliver, in Return to the considerable one in
"Goods which we had of you; but we must own to you that we are at
"present but very ill provided and poor, and have only a very small
"Quantity of Skins, which nevertheless we hope our Brethren will accept.

Here he laid down two small Bundles of Skins.

"We have now nothing more to say in Publick; but having other
"Matters to treat on with the Proprietor, we will enter upon them at
"another time.

They were told, That the Proprietor, President and Council thank'd them
very kindly in Behalf of this Government, for all they had now said; that they
had returned full and distinct Answers to all the Chief Articles or Propositions
made at the last great Treaty in 1732, they had spoke to each of them like
honest Men and true Brethren; and as they had consulted together before they
delivered their Answer, so now the Council would meet and consider together of
all that had passed at present.

Which being interpreted to them, they expressed their Satisfaction by a
Sound peculiar to them, in which they all joined, and then withdrew.

At a Council held at Philadelphia, October 4. 1736.

PRESENT,
The Honourable JAMES LOGAN, Esq; President.

Anthony Palmer,          Ralph Ashetton,
