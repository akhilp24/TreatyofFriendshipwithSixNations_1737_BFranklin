"It has been agreed between us, that we should suffer no Injury to be
"done to one of your People more than to our own, nor without punish-
"ing the Offender in the same manner as if it had been done to one
"of our People; and you also engaged on your parts that you would give
"us the like Satisfaction for every Injury done by your People to any of
"ours, and whatever should happen of this kind, it should make no other
"Difference, than as if the Injury were done by one English or White Man
"to another, and so in the Case of an Indian. Now since you came hi-
"ther, we have heard that a White Man one of our People, and one of
"yours, being both in Liquor, quarrelled at Allegheny, that the Indian struck
"at the White Man with a Knife, and the white Man gave the Indian
"some Blows on the Head, of which he died in four or five Days after;
"that the White Man got out of the way, and hid, and when he heard
"the Man was dead, he ran away to the Southward of Virginia: Who was
"first in the Fault in this matter we know not, but we have now issued a
"Proclamation for apprehending the White Man, and proposed a Reward
"of Ten Pounds, to any one who will seize and deliver him to some Magistrate
"or Officer, that he may be put in Prison and tried for his Life; if then
"it appears that he wilfully kill'd the Man, he will be hang'd by the
"Law; if it was in Defence of his own Life, he is not to die for it; but
"after he is tried we shall acquaint you how the matter appeared. The
"first Account we had of it was in a Letter, which the Interpreter only
"read and acquainted us with; but that Story being told only on one
"side, we do not depend on it for the Truth; and thus we shall act in all
"such Cases, as Brethren always ought whenever they unfortunately happen.

" We are very sensible Rum is the principal occasion of these Disorders, 
" and we heartily wish any means could be possibly found to prevent the 
" Abuse of it: You have desired in your Discourse with the Proprietor to 
" recall all our Traders from Ohio or Allegheny and the Branches of Sasque-
" hannah; We desired at our Treaty four Years ago that all your Indians, the 
" Delawares, Shawnese, and others, should be recalled from Ohio, for we 
" knew not but there might be War with the French, and you know the 
" Strength of a People consists in their being drawn close together into 
" one Body, and not to be scattered; but we know not what you 
" mean by recalling our Traders; for you are sensible the Indians cannot 
" live without being supplied with our Goods: They must have Powder and 
" Lead to hunt, and Cloaths to keep them warm; and if our People do 
" not carry them, others will, from Maryland, Virginia, Jerseys, or other 
" Places; and we are sure you do not desire that Indians should trade with 
" those People rather than with ours. The Traders of all Nations find 
" the Indians are so universally fond of Rum, that they will not deal with-
" out it: We have made many Laws against carrying it; we have ordered 
" the Indians to stave the Caggs of all that is brought among them; but 
" the Woods have not Streets like Philadelphia, the Paths in them cross 
" one Country or another; and on the other hand the Indians are so very 
" fond of the Liquor, even the best of them, that instead of taking it from 
" those who bring it, and staving it, they take and drink it, which is now 
" unjust in it self, and does more Mischief; for the Traders, if they kept
" it,
