“ Tt has been agreed between us, that we fhould fuffer no Injury to be
*¢ done to one of your People more than to our own, nor without punifh-
‘‘ ing the Offender in the fame manner as if it had been done to one
“ of our People ; and you alfo engaged oni your parts that you would give
us the like Satisfaction for every Injury done by your People to any of
“¢ ours, and whatever fhould happen of this kind, it fhould make no other
“« Difference, than as if the Injury were done by one Eygli/hb or White Man
“to another, and fo in the Cafe of an Iedian. Now fince you came hi-

“ther, we have heard that a White Man one of our People, and one of

© yours, being both in Liquor, quarrelled at Allegheny, that the Indian ftruck
“at the White Man with a Knife, and-the white Man gave the Indian
* fome Blows on the Head, of which he died in four or five Days after;
“ that the White Man got out of the way, and hid, and when he heard
<< the Man was dead, he ran away to the Sowthward of Virginia: Who was
* firft in the Fault in this matter we know not, but we have now iffued a
«¢ Proclamation for apprehending the White Man, and propofed a Reward

e

or Officer, that he may be put in Prifon and tried for his Life; if then

| Law; if it was in Defence of his own Life, he is not to die for it, but
after he is tried we fhall acquaint you how the matter appeared. The
“ firft Account we had of it was in a-Letter, which the Interpreter fhall
read and acquaint you with it; but that Story being told only on one
“* fide; we do not depend on it for the Truth ; and thus we fhall a& in all
-fach Cafes, as Brethren always ought whenever they unfortunately happen.

COE a very fenfible Rum is the principal occafion of thefe Diforders,

recall all our Traders from Of/o or Allegheny and the Branches of Sa/que-
hannah, We defired at our Treaty four Years ago that all our Indians, the
Delawares, Shawanefe, and others, fhould be recalled from Ohio, for we
knew not then but there might be War with the French, and you know
the Strength of a People confifts in their being drawn clofe together as.
‘ into one Body, and not to be fcattered; but we know not what you
‘mean by recalling our Traders; for you are fenfible the Indians cannot
' live without being fupplied with our Goods: They muft have Powder and

‘not carty therti, others will, from Maryland, Virginia, Serfeys, or other
* Places; and we are fure you do not defire that Indians fhould trade with
“« thofe Peopie rather than with ours. The Traders of all Nations find

“ the Indians to ftave the Cages of all that is brought amongft them; but.
“the Woods have not Streets like Philadelphia, the Paths in them are
endlefs, and they cannot be ftopt, fo that it will be carried either from

“ fond of the Liquor, even the beft of them, that inftead of taking it from

and we heartily wifh any means could be poffibly found to prevent the |
Abufe of it: You have defired us in your Difcourfe with the Proprietor to ©

Lead to hunt, and Cloaths to keep them warm; and if our People do

the Indians are fo univerfally fond of Rum, that they will not deal with-
out it: We have made many Laws againft carrying it; we have ordered
