OUR BRETHREN,

"FOUR Years since at a great Treaty held here with your Chiefs,
" we confirmed all our former Treaties with you, we brightned the
" Chain, kindled our Fire to be kept always burning here for you, opened
" and cleared the Path between your Country and Ours, and made our-
" selves and you one Body and one People.

" The Chiefs of all your Nations, being met at your great Fire or
" Council in the Country of the Onondagoes, having heard of and considered
" that Treaty, were so well pleased with it, that it was agreed, as you
" have told us, that you, who are the principal of all your Chiefs, should
" come down and visit us, and more fully and absolutely confirm that
" Treaty, which you accordingly did a Few Days since at our great House
" in Town, in the presence and hearing of some Thousands of our People,
" and it was done not only in Behalf of us ourselves and yourselves, but
" for our Children and Children's Children, to all Generations, as long as
" the Sun, Moon, and Earth, endure.

" Thus this Treaty, by which we are to become as one People, and one
" Body, is in the strongest Terms confirmed, never to be changed, but to
" be kept in everlasting Remembrance.

" But, besides what we have already concluded, we shall now for
" the farther brightning the same Chain, and that no Spot or Blemish
" may be fix't on it, speak to some Particulars for your more full Satis-
" faction.
